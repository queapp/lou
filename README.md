This app lets you control stuff by saying so. Yea, that's pretty crazy.
It's like siri only free, open-source and customizable. Did I mention it's written
in coffeescript? And, it doesn't 100% rely on wolfram alpha for everything, like
many other apps out there? (yes, it uses wolfram, only for the the things it
is good at.)
